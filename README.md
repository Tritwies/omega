# Omega ùõÄ
üö© **[NOTE: the project is under active development and some of the features may not be ready or reside in branches other than main]**

_‚ÄúTo live is to be other. It‚Äôs not even possible to feel, if one feels today what he felt yesterday. To feel today what one felt yesterday is not to feel‚Äîit‚Äôs to remember today what was felt yesterday, to be today‚Äôs living corpse of what yesterday was lived and lost. To erase everything from the slate from one day to the next, to be new with each new morning, in a perpetual revival of our emotional virginity‚Äîthis, and only this, is worth being or having, to be or have what we imperfectly are.‚Äù_  ‚Äì Fernando Pessoa

ùõÄ is a mathematical spork of [Zed](https://zed.dev). It aims to delight with:

- first-class **Diagram / Operad** support and fast parallel execution of causal models and graphical languages for monoidal categories (~ parity with [CatCollab](https://topos.institute/blog/2024-10-02-introducing-catcolab/))
- built-in structure-aware editing and version control [beyond git](https://topos.institute/blog/2024-11-13-structure-aware-version-control-via-observational-bridge-types/)
- [extensible multimodal / scientific data support](https://rerun.io/blog/graphs), native viewers for structures in **Physics**, **Chemistry**, **Biology**, parallel simulations incl. **Whole Earth** models, as well as [efficient generators](https://github.com/Microsoft/TRELLIS) for graphs, timeseries, geospatial, 3D data, energy landscapes
- faithful implementation of [Model Context Protocol](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/architecture/) w\ hardened MCP servers and reliable **Effects** and **Capabilities**
- interfaces for first-class DPO graph and categorical (C-Set) rewriting with benchmarking
- include Polymorphic Universes into proof assistant interfaces for the Brave and True (~ parity with [ProofGeneral](https://proofgeneral.github.io), [Lean4 mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4))
- [collaborative](https://topos.institute/blog/2024-10-31-declarative-models-and-collaborative-modeling/) / [compositional world modeling](https://topos.institute/blog/2023-06-15-compositional-world-modeling/), structure transport and matching across disciplines
- **Discourse Hypergraphs** and other knowledge structures + bidirectional integration with a variety of knowledge gardening tools (e.g. citation graphs, ontologies, Obsidian, Ideaflow - primarily w/ MCP) + **proof branching**
- **DuckDB** +vss +spatial for continuous information integration via **Universal Share Targets**: Omega browser extension, mobile app(s), wearables, screen / browser history watchers etc. to ensure **Continuity of Contexts**
- categorically considered multi-agent automations via [task delegation operad](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08373v1) and co-consturction of **Consensus Topos**, evolving planner, codebase navigation capabilities on par with [Agent-Computer Interface in SWE-agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793)
- configurable **time** and **randomness** - including built-in Timelock Encryption https://timevault.drand.love in Omega itself -- as well as the implementation of the **Narrative** category and corresponding temporal graphs into software
- built-in **RISC-V zkVM** (Jolt, RISC0) and **W3C DID** / **ATProto** / **IPFS** and other DeSci integrations
- **Paredit** / **Calva** mode to support S-experssion-based parenthesized languages (Lisps, Schemes) and a bridge between **term rewriting** and **DPO-rewriting** models of computation
- **vim** / **Kakoune** keymap implementation
- random walks & *more*
